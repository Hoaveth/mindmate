## ChatGPT OpenAI API

This was built on top of OpenAI's API. I used this repository for reference: https://github.com/ayaka14732/ChatGPTAPIFree

The API Instance is deployed to GCP (Google Cloud Platform - Cloud Run)

## Host your own instance

If you'd like to run your own instance of ChatGPT API Free, you can easily do so by following these steps:

1) Obtain an OpenAI API Key from OpenAI API Keys.
2) Star and fork this repository on GitHub:  https://github.com/ayaka14732/ChatGPTAPIFree
3) Configure your environment variables correctly.
4) Deploy Docker locally or on Google Cloud Run.
5) Setup rate limit locally or using Google Cloud Armor.
