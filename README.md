## ChatGPT OpenAI API

This was built on top of OpenAI's API. I used this repository for reference: https://github.com/ayaka14732/ChatGPTAPIFree

The API Instance is deployed to GCP (Google Cloud Platform - Cloud Run)

## Host your own instance

If you'd like to run your own instance of ChatGPT API Free, you can easily do so by following these steps:

Obtain an OpenAI API Key from OpenAI API Keys.
Star and fork this repository on GitHub.
Configure your environment variables correctly.
Deploy Docker locally or on Google Cloud Run.
Setup rate limit locally or using Google Cloud Armor.
